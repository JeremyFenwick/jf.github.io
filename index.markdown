## Programming Challenges

### Protohackers

Implement a variety of networking protocols for both UDP/TCP of increasing complexity. The latter challenges have performance restrictions as well. I completed this in both Golang and C# with differing architectural approaches.

*   [Firewatch-C - C#](https://github.com/JeremyFenwick/Firewatch-C)

### HACK

The largest challenge i've attempted overall - build an entire computer up to the operating system from nothing but NAND gates. A very fun project. The bulk of the project is written in the HACK language I wrote the compiler for, but for *that* I used good 'ol C#.

### APOLLO

The ray tracer challenge but I approached this with Test Driven Design to see how I liked it (I didn't actually like it that much... =( ). I implemented the math library myself which is not ideal for performance but forced me to relearn linear algebra.
